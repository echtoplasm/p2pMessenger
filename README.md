# p2pMessenger
A djago project for my portfolio

Was working on making a HIPPA compliant messenging service with django, I got in kind of deep with making 
patient/provider models as well as profile pages almost in the vain of social networking.

I've decided to take a step back and take a more modular approach by making an encrypted messenging application first
and then building the service from there.

The hopes for this project is that I can eventually turn it into a HIPPA compliant chatbot with healthcare documenting 
capabilities. This would save a lot of time and money in the health care world.

The next commit I make to this will be in a new branch, with progress on the messenging capabilities of this service.
